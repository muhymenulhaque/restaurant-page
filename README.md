# restaurant-page
This project was done in order to practice using ES6 modules and webpack during development.
I added all the dom elements with JS for practice.
New feature like tabs are added which is functioned with JS.
I tried to make it a bit humorous but it depends if the person really gets the reference.
I have added a variety of items in meals section. 
There is also a coupon section which countdowns automatically. 

Thanks for visiting!
